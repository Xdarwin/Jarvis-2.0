# Jarvis-2.0
DISCLAIMER
This is a project made by noobs. 

Jarvis 2.0 is the first part of a projet romsala and I are working on for quite a long time.
It is a little rainmeter skin with a cool design (we think) for Windows.
You need to have Rainmeter installed on your pc. Install this skin (just copy-paste it somewhere and 
then choose the new skin in Rainmeter).
WARNING
You need to copy the folder Externals in the root of disk and then change the paths for all the softwares.
